Main Risks: The strategic decision to optimize mobile checkout and implement product bundles and recommendations has received mixed feedback from the executive team. The CEO and CTO support the initiative, highlighting its alignment with the goal of increasing APGA by 20% through improved conversion rates. However, both the CFO and Compliance teams have raised significant concerns regarding the lack of a downside model and compliance review, which they deem critical for assessing financial and regulatory risks. The CFO explicitly blocked the decision due to these unresolved issues, while the Compliance team also indicated that the absence of a compliance review exposes the organization to potential legal and regulatory risks. The operational and technical risks identified by the CEO and CTO further complicate the decision, emphasizing the need for careful management during implementation. Overall, the consensus indicates that while the strategic direction is sound, the necessary risk assessments and compliance checks must be completed before proceeding.
Recommendations: Conduct downside modeling to assess potential negative impacts of the decision.; Perform a compliance review to ensure all regulatory requirements are met.; Define success metrics with clarity.
