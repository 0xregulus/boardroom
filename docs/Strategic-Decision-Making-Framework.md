# Strategic Decision-Making Framework

## **Purpose**

Ensure every major product decision:

- Links to business outcomes
- Is grounded in evidence
- Makes trade-offs explicit
- Has defined risk controls
- Is reversible or irreversible by design

---

# **Overview: 6-Step Decision Model**

1. Strategic Context
2. Problem Framing
3. Option Design
4. Economic & Risk Evaluation
5. Decision & Alignment
6. Execution Guardrails

Each step has artifacts + checks.

---

# **1️⃣ Strategic Context**

### **Objective**

Ensure the decision supports company-level priorities.

### **Key Questions**

- Which company objective does this support?
- What metric moves if we succeed?
- What happens if we do nothing?

### **Required Artifacts**

- 1-page Strategic Alignment Brief
- KPI linkage table (Objective → Metric → Target)
- “Cost of Inaction” statement

### **Checks**

- Is this tied to a top-3 company priority?
- Is the primary metric clearly defined?
- Is the time horizon explicit (quarter, year, multi-year)?

If not → stop.

---

# **2️⃣ Problem Framing**

### **Objective**

Define the real constraint.

### **Key Questions**

- Is this a growth constraint, margin constraint, risk constraint, or operational bottleneck?
- Is this root cause or symptom?
- Who is affected (segment, % revenue, % users)?

### **Required Artifacts**

- Problem Statement (1 paragraph)
- Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys or constraint map)
- Affected Segment & Revenue Impact Estimate

### **Checks**

- Is the problem quantified?
- Is it framed as a constraint?
- Is scope clear?

If it’s vague → it’s not ready.

---

# **3️⃣ Option Design**

### **Objective**

Avoid single-solution bias.

### **Minimum: 3 Options**

- Conservative option
- Balanced option
- Aggressive option

Each option must define:

- Scope
- Timeline
- Resourcing
- Expected impact range
- Risks introduced

### **Required Artifacts**

- Option Comparison Matrix
- High-Level Architecture Implications
- Operational Complexity Estimate

### **Checks**

- Are trade-offs explicit?
- Does at least one option optimize for speed?
- Does at least one option optimize for long-term leverage?

No trade-offs → weak thinking.

---

# **4️⃣ Economic & Risk Evaluation**

This is where most PMs fail. This is where you differentiate.

---

## **Economic Evaluation**

For each option:

- Revenue impact (range)
- Cost impact (engineering + ops)
- Margin effect
- Payback period
- Confidence level

Artifact:

- Simple Financial Impact Model (even directional)

---

## **Risk Evaluation**

Evaluate across 4 dimensions:

1. Regulatory risk
2. Technical risk
3. Operational risk
4. Reputational risk

Artifact:

- Risk Matrix (Impact × Probability)
- Mitigation plan

---

## **Checks**

- Is downside modeled?
- Are assumptions documented?
- Is expected value positive?

If you cannot explain downside → not executive-ready.

---

# **5️⃣ Decision & Alignment**

### **Objective**

Make the call and align stakeholders.

### **Decision Types**

Classify explicitly:

- Reversible decision
- Irreversible decision
- High-risk / high-impact bet
- Incremental optimization

---

### **Required Artifacts**

- Decision Memo (max 2 pages)
- Chosen Option + Why
- Options Rejected + Why
- Assumptions List
- Kill Criteria (when to stop)

---

### **Alignment Checks**

- Does Engineering understand trade-offs?
- Does Finance agree with impact model?
- Does Risk/Compliance approve exposure?
- Is ownership clear?

No decision memo → no clarity.

---

# **6️⃣ Execution Guardrails**

A decision without control loops is irresponsible.

---

### **Define Before Execution**

- Success metrics
- Leading indicators
- Failure triggers
- Review cadence
- Rollback plan (if reversible)

---

### **Required Artifacts**

- KPI dashboard definition
- Review milestone schedule
- Risk monitoring checklist
- Post-mortem template (pre-written)

---

### **Checks**

- Can we detect failure early?
- Can we reverse if needed?
- Is ownership assigned?

---

# **Summary: Required Artifacts List**

For major decisions, you should produce:

1. Strategic Alignment Brief
2. Problem Statement + Root Cause
3. Option Comparison Matrix
4. Financial Impact Model
5. Risk Matrix
6. Decision Memo
7. KPI & Monitoring Plan
8. Kill Criteria Definition
