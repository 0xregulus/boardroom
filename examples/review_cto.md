Main Risks: The integration of new checkout optimization and recommendation systems may introduce unforeseen technical challenges, particularly in ensuring compatibility with existing infrastructure.; The phased rollout approach may lead to inconsistencies in user experience if not managed properly, especially during the transition period.; The reliance on increased conversion rates and average order values may not materialize as expected if user behavior does not align with projections.
Recommendations: The proposed decision to optimize mobile checkout and implement product bundles and recommendations is strategically sound but carries moderate technical risks and complexity that need to be managed carefully to ensure successful execution.
