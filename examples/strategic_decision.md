# **Executive Summary**

Vel’Afrika has stable monthly user volume (~11,500 buyers) while sales grow 3% monthly. The strategic opportunity is not traffic growth but increasing conversion and items per purchase — especially on mobile (60% of traffic) and high-intent product categories like beads (34k visits/month). The decision focuses on improving shopping experience and purchase efficiency to increase APGA by 20% next quarter through conversion optimization, bundle strategies, and logistics-aware recommendations.

# **1. Strategic Context**

- Objective supported:
    - Increase APGA (African Products Going Abroad) by 20% next quarter by improving customer conversion and basket size.
- KPI impact:
    - APGA (primary)
    - Conversion rate (logged-in users)
    - Items per purchase
    - Mobile checkout completion
- Cost of inaction:
    - Revenue growth stalls despite consistent traffic
    - High-intent traffic under-monetized
    - Competitive marketplaces capture demand

---

# **2. Problem Framing**

- Clear problem statement:
    - Vel’Afrika receives significant traffic and product interest but converts a relatively fixed number of customers each month, limiting APGA growth.
- Root cause:
    - Friction in mobile shopping and checkout experience
    - Limited merchandising around high-demand categories (beads)
    - Lack of bundle or recommendation mechanisms increasing order size
- Affected segment:
    - Mobile users (60% of visits)
    - International buyers seeking handmade products
- Quantified impact:
    - 67,000 monthly visits
    - ~11,500 buyers (stable)
    - 17,000 sales monthly → ~1.47 items per buyer average

# **6. Final Decision**

**Chosen option:**

Combine **Option A (Mobile Checkout Optimization)** + **Option B (Bundles & Recommendations)** as phased rollout.

**Trade-offs:**

- Prioritize faster, lower-risk improvements over deep logistics optimization.
- Focus on buyer-side optimization before supply-side complexity.

---

# **7. Kill Criteria**

We will stop or pivot if:

- APGA increase < 5% after 8 weeks
- Checkout conversion drops by >5%
- Recommendation CTR < baseline navigation CTR
- Engineering delivery slips >30% timeline

---

# **8. Monitoring Plan**

- Primary metric:
    - APGA (African Products Going Abroad)
- Leading indicators:
    - Mobile checkout completion rate
    - Items per order
    - Add-to-cart rate
    - Recommendation click-through
- Review cadence:
    - Weekly experimentation review + monthly strategy checkpoint.
